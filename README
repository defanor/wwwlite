WWWLite, a lightweight web browser.

Hypertext documents are targeted, without per-document styling or
executable scripts.

Widely available and well-maintained tools are used, aiming a good
system integration and easy building. System-wide colour and font
settings are respected, parsing and UI building are incremental, image
loading is asynchronous, word cache is used.

At this stage it is rather a proof of concept: many features are
implemented just to the point where it is apparent that they will not
require major design changes to complete; there is not much of error
handling or optimisation, no configuration. Though it is already
capable of rendering and navigating HTML documents.
